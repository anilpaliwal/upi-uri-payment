**upi-uri-payment**

`upi-uri-payment` is a native module for React Native that facilitates UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payments. This module provides a method called openUPIApp which takes a UPI payment intent URL as a parameter and opens a bottom sheet displaying installed UPI apps on the device. Selecting a specific app navigates the user to that app to complete the payment.

**Features**

- Opens a bottom sheet with installed UPI apps on the device.
+ Navigates to the selected UPI app to complete the payment.
- Supports both Android and iOS platforms.

**Installation**

**Using npm**
```
npm install upi-uri-payment
```

**Using yarn**
```
yarn add upi-uri-payment
```


**Linking the Package**
For React Native versions 0.60 and above, the package is automatically linked. For older versions, you need to link the package manually:

```
react-native link upi-uri-payment
```

**Additional Setup for iOS**

**URL Schemes for UPI Apps**

To integrate specific UPI apps in your app, you need to find the URL Schemes for those apps and add them to the `Info.plist` file.


1. Create a master list of UPI apps: Determine the UPI apps you want to integrate into your app. Some common UPI apps include `Google Pay`, `PhonePe`, `Paytm`, `BHIM`, and others.

2. Find URL Schemes: Look up the URL Schemes for each UPI app. You can often find this information in the appâ€™s developer documentation or by searching online.

3. Add URL Schemes to `Info.plist`:

Open your `Info.plist` file and add the URL Schemes for each app. It should look something like this:

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>gpay</string>
  <string>phonepe</string>
  <string>paytm</string>
  <string>bhim</string>
  <!-- Add other URL Schemes here -->
</array>
```

To use the `upi-uri-payment` module, import it into your React Native component and call the `openUPIApp` method with the UPI payment intent URL as a parameter.
